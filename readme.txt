Our task “Toxic Spans Detection” is about extracting toxic phrases (foul language) from a set of 
sentences which are opinionated and might have abusive, biased comments. There are many 
ways this can affect the population as the internet is filled with people’s opinion and free 
speech. For example, Twitter, Reddit, Quora are some of the platforms which allow people to 
let share their thoughts. This also results in other ramifications associated with this such as 
cyberbullying, spreading of hate speech, rise of new trends and cultures like cancel culture etc. 
Thus, the need for automated tools to identify harmful language on internet platforms has 
grown over the past few years. It is time consuming to personally verify every single comment 
and information on the web and it’s no man job. Hence, automating the platforms to aid hate 
speech by detecting toxic phrases and replacing it with decent sentiment might be the work of 
the next decade.
